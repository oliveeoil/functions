In C++, a function needs to have a name, return type, and any parameters in parentheses with brackets for the body of the function. It seems that, in this language, there aren’t specific rules for where you can put a function within a class. It also can support recursive functions, which can be helpful in writing complex code. While calling a function, you can put in multiple parameters in C++, as well as different types of variables as well. However, C++ does not allow you to return multiple values at the same time. You can work around this by using arrays or references. 
This language mainly uses both pass-by-value and pass-by-reference.  Typically, it will run on pass-by-value, but you can run it by reference, as well. During execution, things like your arguments, parameters, and local variables will be stored in the command line. 
For scope, local variables can only be called on within the code block, but global variables can be used anywhere in your code. Side effects can happen if global variables or references are modified. The easiest thing to prevent this would be to make sure you don’t modify your global variables or your references. Your variables will automatically be stored on a stack in your function. This should be all the information you need to start writing your functions!
